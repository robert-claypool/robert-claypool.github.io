Hi, I'm Robert! I've been writing software since 2003.
I love working with &lt;code/&gt;, spatial data, and photography.
My photos are on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/35106989@N08/),
for now. Other stuff will be published here as I find the time.

## In no particular order... Stuff I know:

### > Windows administration
I've never been a full sys-admin, but I've managed dozens of Windows
servers over the years. I know enough about IIS, AD, and domain
controllers to be dangerous, and I can script PowerShell if forced.

### > Linux administration
Most of my dev work is on Linux these days.
I've installed/managed Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Amazon Linux, and
Arch on remote and local machines. I know Bash, SSH, GPG, TMux, Vim, grep, sed,
[etc](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/),
[etc](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line).

The terminal doesn't scare me.

### > Languages
Bash, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, VB .NET, VBA, SQL, PL/pgSQL

I've dabbled in Python.

### > Frameworks
Pretty much the entire ASP.NET stack, especially MVC. I stared doing .NET work
when it was version 1.1.

Angular 2+ and Vue.js -- I have written production apps with both.

React is interesting to me. It's just a matter of time before I pick it up,
but no, I don't know it yet.

For UI work, I really like Semantic UI. I don't like Foundation. Bootstrap is fine.

### > GIS
My career started in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in 2003. I'm an
expert in Esri ArcGIS Desktop, Server, 3D Analyst, Spatial Analyst,
Network Analyst, and APIs. I've built multiple production systems and tools
on this software stack.

Outside the Esri bubble, I know QGIS, PostGIS, Leaflet, TileMill, Carto, and
low-level tools like GDAL, proj.4, and OGR.

### > Web hosting
AWS, GoDaddy, Heroku, whatever.

### > Virtual environments
VMWare and ESXi? Yes. Oracle VirtualBox? Yes.
Vagrant? [Yes](https://github.com/robert-claypool/dotfiles/tree/master/vagrant).

### > Editors
I'm a Vimmer/Neovimmer.
* [https://github.com/robert-claypool/.vim](https://github.com/robert-claypool/.vim)
* [https://github.com/robert-claypool/nvim](https://github.com/robert-claypool/nvim)

For .NET work, I use Visual Studio, VS Code, and Neovim.

### > Source control
Git these days, TFS if needed.

Before Git I used Mecurial, before that SVN, before that Visual Source Safe.

### > DevOps
I have informally filled the role of DevOps engineer everywhere I go -- Webpack,
Grunt, Gulp, MSBuild, TFS, Mecurial (hg), Git, Hudson/Jenkins CI, Flowdock,
Slack, Atlassian Bitbucket/Jira/Bamboo, GitHub, GitLab CE, Docker Compose,
Vagrant, unit testing frameworks, and more.

DevOps isn't about the tools, but the process. I know how to automate things
and get out of a team's way.

### > Data and networking
Redis, NGINX, Docker, Docker Compose, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. I know
all of them pretty well.

I hate Oracle. It's a fine database, but the company is garbage. Postgres is
free and awesome, use that or MySQL instead.

### > AWS and "the cloud"
I'm learning Azure now, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is what I really know.

I have managed a network of servers and services on AWS since 2012.
My experience spans a large number of the core services which are needed to
host and manage online apps:

* Route 53 (DNS routing),
* VPC (virtual private networking),
* S3 and Glacier (storage and static file hosting),
* CloudFront (content delivery and caching),
* Lambda (event-driven, serverless computing),
* IAM (accounts management),
* RDS (relational databases),
* ElastiCache (application caching, NoSQL database),
* Elastic Beanstalk (infrastructure orchestration, PaaS),
* ECS (Docker container hosting and deployment),
* SES and SNS (email and notifications),
* CloudWatch (logging, metrics),
* CodePipeline and CodeDeploy (build procedures and deployments),
* Certificate Manager (SSL cert management),
* IAM user management, encryption options, two-factor auth, security groups, and more.

My experience with AWS goes beyond merely knowing their service capabilities;
I have real-world experience designing architectures which properly use the
dynamic auto-scaling, load balancing, fault tolerant capabilities of AWS,
and I have a good general knowledge of networking and troubleshooting in
such environments.

### > Security
My PGP public key is
[0x6AF2BF57992F19ED](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x6AF2BF57992F19ED).

I don't reuse passwords. Google Auth is my friend.

### > Crypto currencies
It's just a hobby, but I could talk about this for hours.

If you read the [Satoshi whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf),
prepare to be blown away. :)
