Hi, I'm Robert! I've been writing software since 2003.
I love working with &lt;code/&gt;, spatial data, and photography.

## In no particular order... Stuff I know:

### > Windows administration

I know enough about IIS, AD, and domain controllers to be dangerous, and I can
script DOS or PowerShell when needed.

### > Linux administration

Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Amazon Linux, and
Arch on remote and local machines. I know Bash, SSH, GPG, TMux, Vim, grep, sed,
[etc](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/),
[etc](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line).

The terminal doesn't scare me.

### > Languages

Dart, Bash, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, VB.NET, VBA, SQL, PL/pgSQL

I've dabbled in Python.

### > Frameworks

Node.js

The entire ASP.NET stack, especially MVC. I stared writing .NET applications
when it was version 1.1.

Flutter and Dart.

React + Redux, dva + umi, Angular + Ngrx, AngularJS, Gatsby, and Vue -- I have
built production apps on all.

For UI/CSS, I really like Semantic and Ant Design, but not Foundation.
Bootstrap is boring but fine.

### > GIS

My career started in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in 2003. I'm an
expert in Esri ArcGIS Desktop, Server, 3D Analyst, Spatial Analyst,
Network Analyst, and APIs. I've built several production systems and tools
on this software stack.

Outside the Esri bubble, I know QGIS, PostGIS, Leaflet, TileMill, Carto, and
low-level tools like GDAL, proj.4, and OGR.

### > Web hosting

AWS, Firebase, Heroku, Azure, GoDaddy, GitHub Pages, Netlify.

### > Virtual environments and containers

Docker, VMWare and ESXi, Oracle VirtualBox, and
[Vagrant](https://github.com/robert-claypool/dotfiles/tree/master/vagrant).

### > Editors

I'm a Vimmer/Neovimmer.
* [https://github.com/robert-claypool/.vim](https://github.com/robert-claypool/.vim)
* [https://github.com/robert-claypool/nvim](https://github.com/robert-claypool/nvim)

For .NET work, I use Visual Studio, VS Code, and Neovim.

### > Source control

Git, and sometimes TFS.

Before Git I used Mecurial, before that SVN, before that Visual Source Safe.

### > DevOps

I have informally filled the role of DevOps engineer everywhere I go -- Webpack,
Grunt, Gulp, MSBuild, TFS, VSTS, Mecurial (hg), Git, Hudson/Jenkins CI,
Flowdock, Slack, Atlassian Bitbucket/Jira/Bamboo, GitHub, GitLab CE,
Docker Compose, Vagrant, unit testing frameworks, Bash, PowerShell, and more.

DevOps isn't about the tools, but the process. I know how to automate things
and get out of a team's way.

### > Data and networking

Redis, NGINX, Docker, Docker Compose, SQLite, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

Oracle a fine database, but the company is toxic. Postgres is free and
awesome, use that instead!

GraphQL and REST, with or without Swagger.

### > AWS and "the cloud"

I'm learning K8s and Azure now, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is what I know
best.

I have managed a network of servers and services on AWS since 2012.

* Route 53 (DNS routing),
* VPC (virtual private networking),
* S3 and Glacier (storage and static file hosting),
* CloudFront (content delivery and caching),
* Lambda (event-driven, serverless computing),
* IAM (accounts management),
* RDS (relational databases),
* ElastiCache (application caching, NoSQL database),
* Elastic Beanstalk (infrastructure orchestration, PaaS),
* ECS (Docker container hosting and deployment),
* SES and SNS (email and notifications),
* CloudWatch (logging, metrics),
* CodePipeline and CodeDeploy (build procedures and deployments),
* Certificate Manager (SSL cert management),
* IAM user management, encryption options, two-factor auth, security groups, and more.

I have real-world experience designing architectures which properly use the
dynamic auto-scaling, load balancing, fault tolerant capabilities of AWS,
and I have a good general knowledge of networking and troubleshooting in
such environments.

### > Crypto currencies

It's just a hobby, but I could talk about this for hours.

If you read the [Satoshi whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf),
prepare to be blown away. :)
